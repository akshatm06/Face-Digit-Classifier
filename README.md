# Face/Digit Classifier

Implemented 3 different classifier algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Designed the features for each algorithm which assisted classifying pixelated images of faces and digits. Trained the data on a specific dataset for all 3 algorithms and then tested all 3 algorithms for accuracy on a different testing data set. All 3 algorithms had an accuracy of at least 70\% across all face and digit images. Library of code files from Berkeley were used to parse the images and set up the environment.
